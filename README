The program is supposed to tranform the given number in base2 and HEX form of FLoating point.

Even tho it works for most of the cases, sometimes, because c++ uses a fixed point way of storing variables, when the fractional part written in base 2 is infinite,
the last bits will change due to the precision flaw of the variables.

A better approach would be to use arrays to store the number and perform the algorithm, but that would require a lot more time to implement.
