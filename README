#C++ Floating Point to Decimal Conversion Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of a floating-point to decimal conversion algorithm in C++. The algorithm converts a binary floating-point number into its decimal representation. It is commonly used in computer systems to convert and display floating-point numbers accurately.

**How It Works**

The floating-point to decimal conversion algorithm follows the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point representation. The algorithm extracts the sign, mantissa, and exponent from the binary floating-point number and performs the necessary calculations to convert it into decimal form.

The algorithm takes into account special cases, such as positive/negative zero, positive/negative infinity, and NaN (Not a Number), and handles them accordingly. It also considers the rounding modes specified by the IEEE 754 standard.
